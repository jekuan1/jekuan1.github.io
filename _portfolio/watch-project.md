Welcome to my Watch Project page! This project is currently a work in progress, and I'm excited to share some initial details with you.

I will be making a wristwatch with a custom movement. As a mechanical engineer I have always been passionate about product design, electromechanical systems, and consumer electronics. I am proud to say that this project once successful will incorporate all of these ideas.

Mechanical watches have always been fascinating to me as a mechanical engineer. I am excited that I can bring a novel idea to the watch industry.
