# Welcome to My Portfolio

## About Me

I'm currently pursuing my Master of Engineering degree at UC Berkeley, building on my strong foundation from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign where I earned my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering.

My academic journey has been driven by a curiosity for how things work and a desire to create meaningful solutions to complex engineering challenges. I specialize in mechanical systems, product design, and engineering analysis.

## What I Do

- **Mechanical Engineering Design**: Creating innovative solutions for complex problems
- **Product Development**: From concept to prototype to production
- **Engineering Analysis**: Using advanced tools and methodologies to optimize designs
- **Research & Development**: Exploring cutting-edge technologies and applications

## My Approach

I believe in combining theoretical knowledge with practical application. Every project I work on is an opportunity to learn, innovate, and create something that matters. Whether it's designing mechanical systems, optimizing processes, or developing new technologies, I approach each challenge with creativity and technical rigor.
